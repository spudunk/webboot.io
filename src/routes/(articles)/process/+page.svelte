<h2>Start with Research</h2>
<p>
	Did you design your website from a template? Like you looked at a Wordpress template or another
	website in the industry and &lsquo;filled in the blanks&rsquo; with your information? It&rsquo;s a
	pretty common technique, but it&rsquo;s a <em>lame</em> marketing practice. Doing so means your sales
	pitch is based on someone else&rsquo;s website, which probably started from a basic template too.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>A more effective way is the opposite, build your website based on a refined pitch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We like to start with research; understand a market, understand the people spending money in that
	market, then start writing. We write to communicate with them, to connect with them. Then, we
	enhance that with a web page.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>It all starts with research, a message, and most importantly <em>a plan</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ugly inside and (sometimes) out - Provide Background Information</h2>
<p>
	Every day we look at newly created websites and see the same problem over and over again. Some of
	the designs are good, and some even have decent media and copy, but they all seem to miss a few <em
		>crucial</em
	> points.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Call me a geek or whatever, but the code is ugly. Like, did the developers even look at it? Or did
	they just draw the whole thing in an editor and click send without actually looking? Probably the
	latter, actually.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Who cares what the code looks like? Nobody looks at it anyways, right? Well, I do&hellip; and more
	importantly search engines do. With SEO being necessary in the last decade, it&rsquo;s important
	to write for the crawlers too.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Also a common theme, many basic websites are super slooooowwww. Maybe you don&rsquo;t notice when
	you have good internet service, but on a bad connection some sites take several seconds to load.
	We&rsquo;ve all seen it, and it&rsquo;s actually not necessary. 
</p> 
<p>
	Many websites are slow because
	they are bloated, which means they send lots of extra code and data to work. Search engines
	promote pages that don&rsquo;t have extra bloat slowing them down.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	But most importantly, we see a lot of new websites come up with no apparent plan to utilize some
	of the <strong>most powerful digital marketing tools</strong> available today, like mailing lists,
	funnels, or content.&nbsp;
</p>
<h2>What&rsquo;s wrong with these people!? - Present the Problem or Issue</h2>
<p>
	So why do businesses jump into getting a website developed without considering how it connects to
	their marketing plan as a whole? That question isn&rsquo;t rhetorical, I&rsquo;d actually love to
	know. My best guess and hope is that <em>they just don&rsquo;t know their options.</em>
</p>
<p>
	Websites can do a lot more than just serve as a destination for patrons. Amongst other things it
	can be a powerful part of your advertising. Your website should help you get discovered. It should
	connect with people who go by your business every week and never stop to try what you&rsquo;re
	offering. It should pull them through the door by presenting an offer that they can&rsquo;t
	refuse.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	If you&rsquo;re not ready to start then I encourage you to read through some of the free content
	on this site. We want to help you level up your online marketing just to make the internet better.
	There are several articles you may find helpful that you don&rsquo;t have to pay for.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re ready to start, keep reading.</p>
<h2>A goal oriented solution - Offer a Solution</h2>
<p>
	So here&rsquo;s the skinny on <em>our process</em>. We&rsquo;re getting technical and pretty dense
	here so be prepared.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two ways you can start .&nbsp;</p>
<p>One: you delegate the majority of the work to us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two: do it yourself and save money, get help if you need it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fine with either way, really. We&rsquo;re here to support you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option 1 - Research and Planning services&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>starts around $500</li>
	<li>get the blueprint as a bonus</li>
</ul>
<p>Option 2 - Web Marketing Blueprint</p>
<ul>
	<li>our entire process as a guide book for $79</li>
	<li>Unlock huge discounts when you complete parts</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Either way, you&rsquo;ll end up with a similar result: A research backed <strong
		>digital marketing plan</strong
	> for your business. One takes a few hours of your time, two will take a few weeks if you dedicate
	time each day.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Regardless if you do it or we do it, it starts with research.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Research &amp; Plan</h3>
<p>
	Research the customer to understand what drives their purchasing decisions. Understand the barrier
	between them and your product or service, then write an offer they&rsquo;ll jump at.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Collect the keywords, pain points, and wishes of your customer (from reviews). Study the
	alternative offers. Take notes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Do a lot of writing before starting the design.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Offers - that get people to contact you and buy</li>
	<li>Ads - that your customers will want to click on</li>
	<li>Content - to entertain and help your customer so them like your brand</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Integrate keywords and SEO structure, put together graphics and media, then finally&hellip; start
	designing a website.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>
	I&rsquo;ll be honest, I didn&rsquo;t get into this business to design. There are a lot of
	designers out there more talented than me. A lot of the websites I bash on have good designs.
	Design is important, but it&rsquo;s not the bigger problem we&rsquo;re trying to solve.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	That being said,<strong>
		a good designer with the wrong message won&rsquo;t connect with anyone</strong
	>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Put together a comprehensive <strong>Design Brief</strong> that lays out the message and the plan very
	clearly, while still giving the designer room for creativity.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Doing it this way means you&rsquo;ll be sure to get a design that&rsquo;s built around your
	marketing message and offer. This is what&rsquo;s missing on most websites today.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	We have a handful of great designers we like to work with. A couple work as part of our team, some
	we outsource. And all designers like working with us because we make their job EASY, putting
	together all the information they need to start making great design choices.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>
	Now with a great design we figure out how to lay it all out in code. It needs to work nicely with
	all the neat marketing tools that are going to bring your business into the 21st century. Plan,
	write, test, deploy.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Funnels? Check.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Landing pages? Check.</p>
<p>Location pages? Check.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Email integrations? Check.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical SEO? Check.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Content? Check.</p>
<p>Components? Organized and Check.</p>
<p>
	We&rsquo;ll wrap up this step with a lovely website that works <em>super fast</em> and has a
	<em>super modern app-like feel</em>. Actually, it is an app. That&rsquo;s what gives it that
	<em>super modern app-like feel.</em> It makes search engines super happy too. They&rsquo;ll gobble
	your website content up! Yum!
</p>
<p>Website is up so&hellip; we&rsquo;re done? No.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just getting started.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Management</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to breeze over this one because&hellip;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dare I say? <strong>It&rsquo;s not important.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
	It needs to be done, yeah. BUT it <em>shouldn&rsquo;t</em> cost much. It&rsquo;s just overhead, not
	actually helping you grow.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	We offer management pretty close to cost, just enough to cover our overhead of covering your
	overhead.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	I think agencies that charge hundreds for management fees are a rip. There&rsquo;s an article on
	this site about it called Digital Agency Traps.
</p>
<p>
	We&rsquo;ll manage it and make sure it keeps working nicely if you want. Moving on to the good
	stuff&hellip;
</p>
<h3>Promotion</h3>
<p>This is where things get interesting and profitable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	You&rsquo;ll have a powerful, traffic hungry, sales generating monster rumbling behind the gate of
	your web host, waiting for an influx of content consumers to come eat up your content and
	offers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Let&rsquo;s get someone to go there, yeah? Sounds pretty smart, but a lot of businesses just
	squeeze this in as a final step without much thought. They just throw up a super unappealing ad
	(pun intended) that drops the viewer on the homepage! The <em>first</em> point of contact is the
	<em>last</em> thing these &ldquo;digital agencies&rdquo; consider.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Your research and plan gets put into use again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The home and about pages are like a phone book listing, people only find it if they look you
	up.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	The rest of the website is a salesman, connecting the leads from your ads to the content
	they&rsquo;re interested in, showing them products or services to help, and giving them an
	offer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s important -&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
	<li>The ad that gets them in</li>
	<li>The content that makes them like and trust you</li>
	<li>The offer that makes them want to give you their money</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Directing ads to your homepage is a waste of money. You&rsquo;ll get leads, but your cost per lead
	will be really high.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	The big marketing agencies have collected creepy amounts of data from everyone to create <strong
		>unique advertising profiles</strong
	>
	for each of us. If you&rsquo;re marketing online you need to leverage it to be profitable. You do that
	with <strong>targeted marketing</strong>.
</p>
<p>There are two categories here:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Product or service ads</strong> - attract people ready to buy</li>
	<li><strong>Content ads</strong> - attract people interested but not ready to buy</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Product or service ads direct to <strong>landing pages</strong>. Each one is written based on the
	ad as a solution and great offer. You can have multiple landing pages per ad and see which ones
	perform the best.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Content ads can direct to <strong>opt-in pages</strong> where people provide their email for access
	to the content. If the content is helpful and interesting, they&rsquo;ll probably open an email from
	you with more content.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Content ads can also direct to <strong>public content</strong> that they don&rsquo;t need to provide
	their email to read. After the content you can offer them opt-in content via email.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Create content that addresses the problems your customers have. Help them work toward solving
	their problems. When they&rsquo;re ready to buy a solution they&rsquo;ll go to you.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This setup will bring in warm leads immediately, and warm up cold leads over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What about the homepage?&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>It&rsquo;s there (not diminishing the importance of it)</li>
	<li>It provides a high level view of your business</li>
	<li>It reiterates your message and offer</li>
	<li>It directs traffic</li>
</ul>
<h2>Easier Ways</h2>
<p>
	The way we work and build things is more involved than the typical digital agency. It&rsquo;s more
	work. Most businesses use easier methods that spend less time on writing and planning.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>Have a friend build it</h3>
<p>
	I personally started in this industry building websites for friends. That being the case, I have
	to support business owners who want to help their friends. Once word of warning, I&rsquo;ve since
	had to go back and redo all those early websites because they were built with templates, not with
	a good plan.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>Use Wordpress</h3>
<p>
	A lot of businesses use it, so go ahead. Wordpress sites power the majority of internet websites
	for several reasons.&nbsp;
</p>
<ol>
	<li>You can build a professional website without writing code</li>
	<li>It was an early and stable solution that&rsquo;s proven itself long term</li>
	<li>It has a turnkey Content Management System (CMS)</li>
	<li>A lot of add-ons are available to extend its functionality with minimal setup</li>
</ol>
<p>
	There are drawbacks though and we don&rsquo;t use it. We prefer other options, mostly because
	they&rsquo;re performant, clean on the inside, and are more versatile. We write clean code.&nbsp;

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
