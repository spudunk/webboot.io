	<li>35+ page guide to rebuild your online presence</li>
	<li>Everything we do for our highest level clients</li>
	<li>Use this blueprint with your current marketing agency</li>
</ul>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
	We’ve compiled our entire process for researching, planning, and developing digital marketing
	tools for businesses. We’re literally selling our entire business process for &lt; $100!
</p>

<p>
	We're taking a risk because our competition will have it too. We know how much work it is to do
	things right and aren’t scared of anyone beating us with our own process!
</p>

<h2>Why we’re doing this</h2>
<p>
	We set out in this industry to make effective web apps as accessible as possible to the businesses
	we love and care about. After gaining a lot of experience, we’ve realized one of the most
	expensive parts of the entire process is the research and planning phase.
</p>

<p>
	By revealing our entire process, we’re empowering business owners to plan their own digital
	marketing tools and drastically reduce the effort and time it takes us to build a highly effective
	web app. At the same time it provides total transparency to what we do.
</p>

<h2>The problem we want to solve</h2>

<p>
	Most web design agencies work off templates loosely based on the type of business they’re
	designing for. These templates are free across the internet and often only meet the most basic
	requirements of a website. Most businesses are happy with this because it matches their
	competition and gives them an online presence.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that many of these competitors are struggling just as much to get ahead, and
	there’s much more potential for digital assets than a basic brochure website.
</p>
<p>They’re amateur in comparison to modern high performing digital marketing tools.</p>

<h2>What’s included</h2>
