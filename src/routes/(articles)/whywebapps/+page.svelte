<p>
	The way big businesses engage with markets online has been evolving since the beginning of online
	marketing. Naturally smaller businesses' approach to online marketing is going to be behind the
	tech giants, but that gap seems to be opening instead of closing even though the tools are more
	accessable today. I want to help change that. My suggestion:

</p>
<h2 class="font-bold mt-6">The difference between websites and web apps</h2>
<p>
	<strong>Websites</strong> are a set of interconnected web pages. They don’t need Javascript programming
	but support it for adding interactivity. The fundamental structure of websites remains the same as
	it has since the 90s.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Web apps</strong> take a different approach. Instead of loading seperate documents for each
	page, they deliver a Javascript application that displays the content in a more powerful way. It does
	everything websites do but also improves performance and user experience. With web apps you really
	get the best of both worlds.
</p>
<p class="mt-6">
	While websites still do what they are intended to do and can serve a business well, the problem is
	that they are limited. Web apps have limits too (like push notifications on iPhone), but they are
	much more versatile than websites, sitting much closer to the abilities of native apps (like you
	install from the app store) than websites.
</p>

<p>If your business wants to implement features like these, there really isn’t a choice:</p>
<ul>
	<li>client accounts</li>
	<li>chats</li>
	<li>games</li>
	<li>user generated content</li>
	<li>dynamic content based on user preferences</li>
	<li>integrate with a CRM or APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Web apps give you complete control over what each individual user sees, like how Facebook and
	Instagram feeds are different for each user. It’s also worth mentioning that web apps are super
	fast. The frameworks are designed to handle much more difficult tasks while maintaining good
	performance, so for most businesses the performance is overkill. This really benefits SEO.
</p>

<h2>What should I use?</h2>
<p>
	Our suggestion is to <span class="bg-lime-100"
		>start with a web app with just the features you need.</span
	> You’ll get better performance, better data collection, and when you want to add features later you
	won’t have to start over. Your business will have a slick repository of code that works for you, automating
	what you want to automate and engaging with your customers the way you want. This puts you in control
	of your content and allows some independence from the platforms we can’t control (Instagram, Facebook,
	Twitter/X) while still allowing you to play nicely with them.
</p>
<p>
	Another great perk, you can share that repository with any developer in the world in a secure way.
	If you find someone who does slick animated graphics (or any other niche), you can have them
	submit a pull request to your repository. Let your agent look it over and with just a few
	keystrokes they can deploy it live to your website, no sharing passwords necessary.
</p>

<h2>The tradeoffs</h2>
<p>
	The only real potential tradeoffs are initial cost and availability of people who can work on it.
	Web apps aren’t something that can be built and managed by your average local Wordpress designer.
	To build a web app well a developer needs to understand how websites work at their core and how
	their framework works, on top of all the skills a Wordpress designer has.
</p>
<p>
	Fortunately making the equivalent of a Wordpress website is trivial for the folks who have taken
	the time to acquire these skills, and you aren't limited to expensive plugins and a slow platform.
	Plus, developers that are fantastic with these modern tools are abundantly available across the
	globe and in many cases willing to work for less than you might expect. Building a web app may be
	marginally more expensive, but the performance and feature options just aren’t available to
	traditional websites.
</p>

<h2>How we keep the cost of web apps low</h2>
<p>
	Our agency was built around the principle of enabling businesses to embrace the potential of the
	internet, so we offer packages to compete with even the most cost effective website design
	agencies. We have a few tricks up our sleeve to manage this.
</p>
<ol class="list-inside">
	<li>
		Web apps are modular, meaning we can quickly copy common parts from our library to make most of
		your web app very quickly, where other tools make you work through the whole process manually
		each time. We don’t charge for building these reusable parts, just the time it takes to
		implement them. Wordpress agencies can’t really reuse parts the way we can and have to charge
		for configuring everything. Instead of adapting one big template to fit your needs, we can
		combine several smaller components to quickly build out exactly what you need.
	</li>
	<li>
		Web apps are built in code, and the tools for writing and collaborating on code are much more
		developed than most website tools. Letting one person work on design while another writes
		content and another sets up backend data handling is simple. Coding tools (like Git and GitHub)
		were developed to allow thousands of developers to work on a single project together, so
		collaborating within a small agency is trivial.
	</li>
	<li>
		We use these same technologies to streamline our workflow. If we find part of our process is too
		clunky or slow, we just write some code to automate or streamline it. Good luck keeping up
		Wordpress designers!
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Web apps can grow in stages</h2>
<p>
	We really do enjoy building tools that help businesses. You don’t have to adapt your business to
	work within the bounds the website builder supports. We build exactly what you need and make a
	tool that works with your business the way you want it to. You can start out as small and simple
	as you want and roll out additional features as you want.
</p>

<h3>Here’s an example</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		Start with a basic brochure website
		<ol>
			<li>Branding</li>
			<li>Products</li>
			<li>About</li>
			<li>Contact Form</li>
			<li>Insane performance</li>
		</ol>
	</li>

	<li>
		When you’re ready upgrade to a content website (still could do this with a website)
		<ol>
			<li>Maximize SEO</li>
			<li>Generate organic traffic</li>
			<li>Libs & data modeling</li>
		</ol>
	</li>

	<li>
		Add a Client Platform (difficult for a website to do)
		<ol>
			<li>Invoicing</li>
			<li>Job history</li>
			<li>CRM, Project management</li>
			<li>Integrated card payments</li>
		</ol>
	</li>

	<li>
		Make it a full Engagement platform (outside website territory)
		<ol>
			<li>Users, usernames, and comments</li>
			<li>User generated content</li>
		</ol>
	</li>

	<li>
		Make it a full Social platform
		<ol>
			<li>Share and collaborate on projects from the planning phase on</li>
			<li>
				Let users interact with each other and share their projects, get ideas and feedback from
				other users
			</li>
			<li>Let users post reviews and share their experiences</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Future proof your digital marketing</h2>
<p>
	All in all web apps give you flexibility to adapt and take advantage of whatever the future may
	bring. We choose to build them because we want to close that gap between what big tech companies
	do with their online assets and what the businesses we actually love do with theirs. We want to
	level the playing field. We want to modernize your business and build you an asset that will work
	tirelessly for you day in and day out. We want to give you a tool that can grow with your company
	and its needs, without hitting limits.
