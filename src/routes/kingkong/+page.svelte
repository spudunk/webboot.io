	<p class="text-4xl font-bold my-24">It's about time you showed up.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		You have no idea how excited I am. When I see that beautiful blue Southern Cross show up in my

	<p class="mb-4">

		You want to make your team even better, to make the internet better, and to make marketing more

	<p class="mb-4">
		Am I right? Well that&rsquo;s what I want too. The internet would be <strong

		if every website was well designed and developed, if every ad consisted of helpful content, if information

	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">I know what you&rsquo;re wondering&hellip;</p>
	<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-12">Who is this Chris guy?</h2>
	<p class="mb-4">It's me, Christopher Hicks</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		I&rsquo;m a farm kid who grew up in the land of cows and trees, right next door to a chicken
		farm. Know the smell?&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		When little Christopher was growing up though, he didn&rsquo;t dream of having his own log
		trucks, herds of cattle, or chicken farm.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		He dreamed of a hybrid digital world, where every fascinating mechanical thing was made better
		with code.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		So while other kids were showing animals at the fair, little Christopher was learning how to
		bypass the school&rsquo;s firewalls.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4 font-bold">I got serious about computers around 20 years ago.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		But wouldn&rsquo;t you know it, life didn&rsquo;t make coding my occupation early on. Instead,
		the oil boom in North Dakota was happening and I didn't want student debt.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		For those unfamiliar with US geography, North Dakota is an empty desert of nothing but some of
		the worst weather in our country, like -40 degrees at night (parity between units cold).&nbsp;
	</p>
	<UsMap />
	<p class="mb-4">
		Unregrettably, I went to work in the frozen trenches welding together pipes throughout our
		oilfields. I learned what it takes to build our country, and I learned what it&rsquo;s like to
		be the bluest of blue collar workers.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Then economics shut down the oil boom and it all stopped. So, what else would I have done but
		enlist in the US Marine Corps? Surely, economics wouldn't interfere with that.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		It was one of the greatest experiences of my life. It&rsquo;s where I learned that a team is way
		more powerful than any individual. It&rsquo;s where I learned leadership. I was set to graduate
		as &ldquo;guide&rdquo; of my platoon. I felt like I&rsquo;d found where I belonged, with my
		team, in the shit.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Three months into the greatest summer camp of all time, I was <em>medically separated</em> for a
		&ldquo;condition&rdquo; that didn&rsquo;t impair me at all, but it was a liability to their
		<strong>insurance policy!</strong>
		They jipped me part of my pay and kicked me to the street
		<em>one day before graduation</em>.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4 font-bold">Economics interfered <em>with that</em> too.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Bollocks! Gotta start over again!&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="mb-4">It was bad luck, but may have been for the better.</p>
	<div class="bg-neutral-100 p-2 mb-4">
		<p class=" text-emerald-900 font-bold">
			I&rsquo;m only explaining this to be open about who I am and why I&rsquo;m here, so hang in
			there it gets better.&nbsp;
		</p>
	</div>

	<p class="mb-4">
		I was starting to get a sense that I would have to make my own way, but didn&rsquo;t yet know
		what that was going to be.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		From there I spent a few years traveling around the country like a hippie, working odd jobs
		(some very odd). I even went back to North Dakota for a short blip of high oil prices but they
		didn't last.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Finally, I decided to move to the city to try on a white collared shirt&hellip;
	</p>
	<h2 class="mb-4 font-bold">Hello Portland.&nbsp;</h2>
	<p class="mb-4">
		I worked a few entry level jobs and had some side hustles around the city trying to work my way
		up to something that would let me realize my entrepreneurial potential.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		My big break: A guy named Jim hired me to install workbenches in his garage (my handyman side
		hustle).&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Jim was a big power guy, a solar developer. He saw my potential and brought me into his latest
		venture, developing industrial real-estate for data centers. That was a tough gig: long hours,
		high expectations, and delayed rewards.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		While I was there I learned about energy, development, business, and finance. I built some
		really cool tools that really made a difference in the team's workflow.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Things were going pretty well. The company was completely funded by investors, but we were on
		track to close a real big deal. It would pay off in just a handful of years!
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		It was all very exciting until&hellip; COVID. Economics went bad, we lost funding and I (along
		with the majority of the staff) was unemployed again.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		I started thinking, &ldquo;What kind of business is going to provide remote income, utilize my
		tech skills, and be resistant to crazy international events like COVID and whatever else is
		coming?&rdquo;
	</p>
	<div class="bg-neutral-100 p-2 mb-4">
		<p class="mb-4 text-emerald-900 font-bold">
			You guys (King Kong) are in the right business. I&rsquo;d love to see the stats, I bet you
			were pretty much &ldquo;covid-proof&rdquo;.&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p class=" text-emerald-900 font-bold">
			If economics get weird in the future, I want to be in a business like that.
		</p>
	</div>
	<p class="mb-4">
		I&rsquo;ve got it, I have to build something online! But in such a competitive international
		marketplace, what could I actually contribute? What can I bring to the table that isn&rsquo;t
		out there?
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4"><em>What problems could I do better on?</em></p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		I had it! Most small businesses, specifically the ones I love the most, have <em>terrible</em> websites!&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		So I can just build awesome websites for all these small businesses and charge them something
		they&rsquo;re willing to pay! Brilliant!
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		(reality check: <span class="text-red-800 font-bold">not so brilliant</span> )
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Small businesses are small because small business owners are DIYers that don&rsquo;t invest in
		marketing and scaling leadership.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4 text-green-900 font-bold">
		You see where I&rsquo;m going with this, don&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;re a keen, finely tuned
		marketing machine! You could have foreseen these problems before I even started.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		But then, I saw Sabri on my Facebook feed and purchased <em>Sell Like Crazy</em>. It was a game
		changer.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		After reading it I looked back at my website and thought, &ldquo;Obviously I&rsquo;m not going
		to get any sales that way! My CTA goes straight to checkout, that will never work!&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Sabri wasn&rsquo;t kidding when he wrote in the first chapter that it would be a lot of work to
		do it his way. It&rsquo;s <em>a lot of work</em>, especially for one person! My hat is off to
		Sabri.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Since essentially I&rsquo;m marketing <em>marketing</em>, I should effectively get myself
		clients the same way I will get my clients <em>clients</em>. I don&rsquo;t want to start a
		cold-call agency, so I&rsquo;ve stopped cold-calling.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-12">So that brings me to about where I am now:</h2>
	<ul class="list-inside list-disc mb-4">
		<li>
			studying books like <em>Sell Like Crazy</em> by Sabri and <em>$100M Offers</em> by Alex Hormozi,&nbsp;
		</li>
		<li>trying to level up my marketing skills so I can go after growing businesses</li>
		<li>trying to find a niche where my skills are valued</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="mb-4">Is it custom apps for businesses that need automation?&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Is it funnels and email marketing?&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Maybe just copywriting and Ads</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		The point is, I haven&rsquo;t figured out how to make <em>the webboot thing</em> get traction. I&rsquo;m
		doing work, closing deals, but NOT GETTING PAID.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Seriously, I have done A LOT of work, had contracts with amounts, dates and deliverables, but
		still <em>every</em> invoice in my Stripe is sitting there unpaid. Unfortunately, I love these little
		businesses too much to take their stuff offline, so I don&rsquo;t have any leverage.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="my-8 text-2xl">It's like the universe is pushing us together.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		To be completely honest, my back is against the wall. My girlfriend has been paying the bills
		and supporting my vision of creating something that can bring her home and give us both
		financial freedom.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Her name is Angel, and she lives up to her name. She literally just made me mandarin noodles
		while I&rsquo;m writing this. (forgot to take a picture, gone too fast)&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		It&rsquo;s been a year since this started (not our relationship, but her paying the bills and me
		building a business), and I need to come up with something soon. For the sake of our
		relationship. <strong>PLEASE HIRE ME</strong>.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		If you don&rsquo;t hire me I&rsquo;m going to keep at it, <em>whatever it takes.</em>
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4 font-bold">I&rsquo;m going to figure it out.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		I&rsquo;m building my own funnel from scratch because Sender.net has weak scheduling options and
		doesn&rsquo;t make it to the Primary inbox after the second email&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4 text-green-900">
		I know what does make it to Primary, it just doesn&rsquo;t have scheduling <em>yet</em>. Stay
		tuned for updates.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">I&rsquo;m writing HVCOs and opt-in pages.</p>
	<p class="mb-4">I&rsquo;m writing SEO articles.&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		I&rsquo;m subscribed to every King Kong funnel I can find and taking notes on the several emails
		I get each day. (though I&rsquo;ve lost the ability to study the timing because they all go to
		the same address, oops)
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">I&rsquo;m running Facebook ads and A/B testing.&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Eventually, I am going to figure out what works, but that may be too late for my
		relationship.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		So right now, I have to get a job. Either I get one I&rsquo;ll stick with for a long time like
		King Kong, or something just to fill the gap. I&rsquo;m seriously considering a <a
			href="https://seattle.craigslist.org/oly/mnu/d/chehalis-assembly-technician/7683727441.html"
			target="_blank"
			class="text-blue-800 underline"

		and a
		<a

			target="_blank"
			class="text-blue-800 underline"
			rel="noopener">shop laborer job</a
		> to pay the bills! Either one will take the weight off Angel&rsquo;s shoulders and fund some new
		graphics for webboot.io (soon to be rebranded unless you hire me). I&rsquo;ve already started dropping
		applications!
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4 font-bold text-xl">Then I discovered this:</p>

	<picture class="block max-w-4xl my-4">
		<source srcset="lpcontent/console.png" type="image/png" />
		<img src="lpcontent/console.png" alt="King Kong console message" />
	</picture>
	<p>If you're wondering if I liked that idea... yes I did. Check it out :)</p>

	<p class="mb-28 mt-20">
		So now, feeling a special invitation has been made to me, here I am; admitting you&rsquo;re
		better and wanting to get on board.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-28">Take a minute to think about that&hellip;</p>
	<p class="mb-4 text-2xl mb-28">You, me, Luke, all working together. Just picture it&hellip;</p>

	<picture class="block max-w-4xl my-4">
		<source srcset="lpcontent/kk-team-web.webp" type="image/webp" />
		<source srcset="lpcontent/kk-team-web.jpg" type="image/jpeg" />
		<img src="lpcontent/kk-team-web.jpg" alt="King Kong team with Chris on it" />
	</picture>

	<p class="mb-4 mt-12">Looks good right? I think so!</p>
	<p class="mb-4 mt-12">
		I could come in, synchronize with the team, and learn how to do things the King Kong way. I can
		help optimize your landing pages, your website, and everything for your clients that hasn't been
		done. I&rsquo;ll get all the technical SEO stuff <strong>singing</strong> to crawlers, with Open
		Graph tags, JSON-LD structured data, and perfect HTML5 semantics.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Or I could refactor and optimize the new sites and funnels to make sure they&rsquo;re super fast
		and get perfect Lighthouse scores before they're deployed. &nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Or maybe you want me on the front lines in the United States. With my construction experience I
		can &ldquo;talk the talk&rdquo; with contractors. I even have some ideas on how to break into
		the timber industry, marketing for logging companies, mills, and foresters.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Or I could join your creative copywriting team. (maybe too far a stretch)</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Or, if nothing else, just get all the image optimizations working with long srcsets so your
		funnels are even faster on mobile devices.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">I'll do the grunt work if it gets me in the door.</p>

	<h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-bold mt-12">Are you hesitant...</h2>
	<p class="mb-4">
		to show me all your processes because I&rsquo;m a competitor? (technically, but a small one)
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		I personally pledge my loyalty, and won&rsquo;t make webboot a higher priority than the King
		Kong team objectives. I may even be willing to put webboot aside altogether.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		If you&rsquo;re worried that I&rsquo;ll take your ideas, quite the opposite is true. I&rsquo;ll
		share my ideas openly with you.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		If you think I might not have enough experience&hellip; well, you might have me there.
		There&rsquo;s SO MUCH I&rsquo;ll have to learn from you. I&rsquo;m a quick study and promise to
		get up to speed as fast as humanly possible.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		I&rsquo;m sure you need proof that I can actually code. I hope this page shows a lot.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Beyond this though, look at the rest of this website. It&rsquo;s totally mobile responsive, has
		decent form messages, and has great lighthouse scores.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Check out my <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>. I&rsquo;ve
		done a lot that isn't there, but some stuff is worth showing.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-12">My biggest fear right now</h2>
	<p class="mb-4">
		is a reply that says, <strong>
			&ldquo;Thank you for inquiring about careers at King Kong. Unfortunately, we don&rsquo;t hire
			remote workers, or from the USA. We wish you the best of luck&hellip;&rdquo;
		</strong>
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		<span class="font-bold text-lg">I know!</span> It&rsquo;s a big time difference. I&rsquo;m fine starting
		my Monday morning on Sunday afternoon and working into the night to stay on the team&rsquo;s schedule.
		I&rsquo;ll even get up early and work with US clients the next morning.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		I&rsquo;ll get Starlink so I can video call and work at the same time, and book the conference
		room at the library or work at a friend's house until it arrives.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		You can hire me as a contractor if it&rsquo;s easier than as an employee.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		I&rsquo;ll even come to Melbourne to meet the team! I&rsquo;ve been wanting to see Australia
		anyways.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">The point is, we can make it work!</p>
	<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-12">So here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in store for us</h2>
	<ul class="list-inside list-disc mb-4">
		<li class="">More enthusiasm on the team.</li>
		<li class="">A stronger sense of purpose.&nbsp;</li>
		<li class="">An <em>inside</em> connection in the US.&nbsp;</li>
		<li class="">More capacity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
		<li class="">
			My best friend sticking around to support me doing the best work I can do <span class="italic"
				>for you</span
			>.&nbsp;
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="mb-4">
		That&rsquo;s a much better outcome than laughing about this page and moving on.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		It&rsquo;s the <span class="font-bold">fastest way you can increase your capacity </span>for
		building highly optimized digital assets right now.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">Think about it&hellip; but not for too long.&nbsp;</p>
